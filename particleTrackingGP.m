%% changelog.
% original version  particleTrackingGP
% version 0_0_1     added subfunction calcLengthAndTimeSteps() for further evaluation
%                   - truncate 'particles' array to particles which were
%                   found in e.g. 10 time steps (-> user input)
%                   - calculate the length of the path as additional info
%                   - meta data is automatically saved in folder
% version 0_0_2     added subfunction drawPathInImage() (-> user input)
%                   -> needs calcLengthAndTimeSteps() becasue of idsOfInterest
